Hi Bernie,

Please find attached the software we've made some changes to and an
associated release note. Our intention was to get an embedded DL device to
work with CentOS 5.3, having both the USB display adapter and native (Intel)
adapter working at the same time (in various modes). We've mostly tweaked
around the edges to make the software a bit more robust and tidy.

This was based upon version 0.1 of the Linux framebuffer driver (merge of
Roberto and Jaya's drivers with enhancements) and the XorgDisplaylink
sources from Roberto De Ioris.

If you could get this stuff published as-is somewhere with credit to
Endurance, then feel free to pick and merge stuff as you like into other
strands of development. I don't think there will be too much to diff.

Let me know if you need any more info.

Thanks for your help,

Steve
